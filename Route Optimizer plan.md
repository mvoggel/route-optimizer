# **Route Optimizer - SJ Blinds**



###### Metrics to report: 

Travel Time (period used: 1 week)

&nbsp;	- Find the avg travel time per rep per day

&nbsp;	- Find the avg travel time between appointments 

&nbsp;	- Miles per job (total miles / total jobs)



Travel inefficiencies 

&nbsp;	- No. times each rep back tracks (weekly) - days where a rep drives past an area, then returns later in the same day

&nbsp;	- No. days with backtracking / total work days

&nbsp;	- Time taken in overlapping routes





##### Goal and KPIs are changes to these: 

* *Decrease drive time and fuel costs* 
* *Decrease scheduling time*
* *Increase jobs per rep per week*
* *Increase available selling hours* 
* *Efficiency - more revenue capacity without hiring (aka more revenue per day)*



*^^ This is what we're tying our work towards - this is our business ROI/value.* 

*Use real numbers in your chat with them.* 



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



### Short-term strategy:

Problem: New appointments are assigned randomly, based on rep availability at the time of appointment creation (called "round robin")

Solution: Implement geographical priority, to efficiently select reps



##### Custom Router (Matt builds) 

Pros 

* You own this model - free to do whatever we want - cheapest long term
* Scalable for your exact business needs (adding job size, etc.) 
* &nbsp;	Great first project to identify other business value that we can deliver using your current setup
* Doesn't change a single process on your end, or the users' end 
* All workflows, systems, and software stay the same - this integrates
* You own all your data





Cons 

* I'm one man 
* Not created this specific thing before
* &nbsp;	Confident, but timing may be a little longer 
* Testing is always a bit of a black box as a result 



Timing and Cost: 

* 4-6 weeks (hoping it's on the lower end - setting up the initial router logic is my unknown)
* $1500 flat project fee

##### 3rd party (Matt can help middle-man, other company builds)

Pros

* They exist to do this exact thing (Peace of mind)
* Will probably be quicker once they're onboarded
* &nbsp;	Once onboarded, will probably faster time to market (it will be like getting access to an app)
* Normally they have more robust algorithms than just "zip code comparison"
* I can manage technical implementation, any optimizations we'd want



Cons 

* They never fit your exact business case (usually get you 80-90% of what you want) 
* &nbsp;	Harder to fit your CRM directly
* More expensive (per-driver costs is usually how they structure, plus an up front fee)
* Changes you and your reps process - its a new software, new login, new map, etc.



Companies to prospect: 

* OptimoRoute
* BadgerMaps
* Map my Customers
* Spotio



Timing and Cost: 

* 1-3 weeks once signed with company 
* Rough estimate of ~$150 - $200/monthly with company + monthly cost for me
